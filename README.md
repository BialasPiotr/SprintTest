# SprintTest

The code creates several sample UserStory and Bug objects, and then adds them to a Sprint object.
Next, a UserStory object is created and marked as completed, and an attempt is made to add it to the Sprint - but it is rejected because the task is already completed.
Similarly, an attempt to add a UserStory with too large an estimate is rejected.
